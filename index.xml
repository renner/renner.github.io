I created this page as a personal portfolio and to showcase some of my photography and other projects.
I take inspiration from streets, landscapes, people, the sky, or anything that has beautiful shapes or colors. Working professionally as Engineering Manager for an international software company I spend my available time as a curious programmer of open source software, enthusiastic photographer and I especially enjoy being outdoors climbing rocks as well as taking pictures of other people climbing.</description></item><item><title>Photography</title><link>https://renner.github.io/photography/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://renner.github.io/photography/</guid><description>This is some selected photography in several albums:
