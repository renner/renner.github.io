I created this page as a personal portfolio to showcase some of my photography and projects.
Creative expression is an important part of me, with my photography I like to capture aesthetics of scenarios surrounding me in a non-arranged way. My favorite genres are photojournalism, documentary and street photography. I am a passionate person in general, active in outdoor sports like rock climbing and surfing, knowledgeable and curious about technology, programming and engineering of open source software.</description></item><item><title>Photography</title><link>https://renner.github.io/photography/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://renner.github.io/photography/</guid><description>This is some selected photography in several albums:
