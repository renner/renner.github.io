I created this page as a personal portfolio and to showcase some of my photography and other projects.
I like to document the scenes happening around me, non-arranged photography on streets, in forests, at home or while traveling. Apart from being an enthusiastic rock climber and photographer, I like to spend time as a curious programmer of open source software and I work professionally as Engineering Manager for an international open source software company.</description></item><item><title>Photography</title><link>https://renner.github.io/photography/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://renner.github.io/photography/</guid><description>This is some selected photography in several albums:
