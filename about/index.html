<meta name=twitter:description content="Hello, my name is Johannes. I created this page as a personal portfolio to showcase some of my photography and projects.
Creative expression is an important part of me, with my photography I like to capture aesthetics of scenarios surrounding me in a non-arranged way. My favorite genres are photojournalism, documentary and street photography. I am a passionate person in general, active in outdoor sports like rock climbing and surfing, knowledgeable and curious about technology, programming and engineering of open source software.">
